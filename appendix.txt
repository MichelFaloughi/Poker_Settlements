inputs:
- number of players
- unique ids for each player (like names for example)
- How much each player bought in
- How much each player finished with 

Output:
- How much each user is owed and how much each player owes
- Example solution generator (who pays who how much, in order to minimize the transactions), maybe use AI for this ?



UI:
A table around which all the users sit, starts empty
An option to add users, with the amount they bought in, and the amount they finished with
An option to delete users, where there will be a dropdown menu to select one of the users which to delete
A "clear table" option, to delete all the users and go back to the initial empty table 
An option to "settle" (once all the users have been added, here we can make sure that the sum of buy-ins = sum of money ppl have left)



Assumptions:
- This is only to be used for when the game is over, for now
- This is for Texas hold'em around a table not a tournament.
